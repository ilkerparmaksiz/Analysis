The Characterization data is obtained by a Pico Amp. Meter at Dr Brandt's Lab CPB220. Vargese has setup a single PE beam using 405 nm Laser and Neutral density filters initially pointing to MCP PMT with same QE of the other PMTs. Using pulse height distribution, we obtained probability of getting noise vs single PE and calculation has showed that we mostly get SPE then this beam is directed to the PMTs. We have obtained the current measurements and Single Pulses from the scope. Since the Single Pulses occupies vary large space they are not stored in this folder. If you need Individual pulses then , pleaase contact me.
